            Review the skill changes in PR ${{ github.repository }}/pull/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}.

            Use the skill-creator skill guidelines to evaluate each skill. For each SKILL.md changed, review the full skill directory (scripts/, references/, assets/) against the skill-creator best practices.

            Structure your review in two sections:

            **Changes in this PR**: Feedback on the specific lines/content added or modified in this PR. This is the primary focus.

            **Pre-existing issues** (optional): If you notice issues with the skill that existed before this PR, briefly note them here. Keep this section short - the author isn't responsible for fixing everything.
