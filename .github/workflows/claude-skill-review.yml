            Review the skill changes in PR ${{ github.repository }}/pull/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} using the skill-creator guidelines.

            Focus your review on these key areas:

            **1. Frontmatter Quality**
            - Does SKILL.md have proper YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description` fields?
            - Is the `description` comprehensive enough to trigger the skill appropriately?
            - Does description include both what the skill does AND when to use it?

            **2. Conciseness (Context Window is a Public Good)**
            - Is the SKILL.md under 500 lines?
            - Does it only include information Claude doesn't already know?
            - Are examples used instead of verbose explanations where appropriate?

            **3. Progressive Disclosure**
            - Is content split appropriately between SKILL.md and references/?
            - Are reference files properly linked and described in SKILL.md?
            - Is detailed/variant-specific content moved to reference files?

            **4. Degrees of Freedom**
            - Is specificity matched to task fragility?
            - Are scripts used for fragile/deterministic operations?
            - Is appropriate flexibility given for context-dependent decisions?

            **5. Resource Organization**
            - Are scripts/ for executable code that needs deterministic reliability?
            - Are references/ for documentation loaded as-needed?
            - Are assets/ for output resources (templates, images)?
            - No extraneous files (README.md, CHANGELOG.md, etc.)?

            **6. Quality Standards**
            - Uses imperative/infinitive form in instructions?
            - No deeply nested references (keep one level deep)?
            - Large reference files (>100 lines) have table of contents?

            Provide specific, actionable feedback for any issues found. Be constructive and explain why each suggestion improves the skill.
