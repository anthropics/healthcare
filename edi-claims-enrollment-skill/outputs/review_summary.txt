Claim Details:
  Claim Amount: $5,500.00
  Service Date: 2024-03-05
  Place of Service: 21 - Inpatient Hospital
  Procedure: 99285 - Emergency Department Visit (High Severity)
  Diagnoses: I10 (Hypertension), E119 (Diabetes Type 2)
  Submitter: ABC MEDICAL BILLING (ID: SUBMITTER001)

================================================================================
❌ CRITICAL ISSUE: Member Not Eligible on Service Date
================================================================================

QUICK DIAGNOSIS:
  Member ID: MBR87654321
  Service Date: 2024-03-05
  Coverage terminated: 2024-03-01 (4 days before service)
  Claim Amount: $5,500.00
  Service Type: Emergency Department Visit
  CPT Code: 99285 (High Severity ER)

POSSIBLE CAUSES (Ranked by Likelihood):

  1. ✓ MOST LIKELY (60% confidence): Actual termination
     Member genuinely not covered on service date

     Evidence: Based on 152 similar cases this year, 65% were actual
              terminations that were correctly denied

     Next Step: Verify member status in eligibility system

     If Confirmed: Deny claim with member notification
                  Use denial code: CO-27 (Expenses incurred after coverage
                  terminated)

  2. ⚠️ POSSIBLE (25% confidence): Retroactive termination error
     Awaiting 834 correction from employer

     Evidence: Recent termination with only 4-day gap. Pattern common with
              late 834 transmissions from employers

     Next Step: Check for pending 834 corrections in system
               Contact employer group to verify termination date

     If Correction Expected: Pend claim for 7-14 days pending 834 update
                           Set reminder to re-check eligibility

  3. 🔍 CONSIDER (15% confidence): Emergency services exception
     Policy may cover emergency services with grace period

     Evidence: CPT 99285 detected (high-severity ER visit)
              Some benefit plans cover emergency services 3-7 days post-term

     Next Step: Review emergency services policy section
               Check if member's plan includes post-termination ER coverage

     If Applicable: Process claim under emergency exception
                   Apply emergency benefit levels and member cost-sharing

HISTORICAL CONTEXT:
  → You've processed 23 similar eligibility exceptions this month
  → Resolution breakdown:
     - 15 denied (actual termination) - 65%
     - 6 approved after 834 correction - 26%
     - 2 approved via emergency exception - 9%

  → Trading partner SUBMITTER001 has 12% eligibility exception rate
     (Higher than your 8% system average - consider outreach/training)

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
  Step 1: Verify current member status in eligibility system
  Step 2: Check if emergency services exception applies (review policy)
  Step 3: If termination confirmed → Deny claim with member notice
  Step 4: If awaiting correction → Pend claim for 7-14 days

RESOLUTION METRICS:
  Estimated Time: ~15 minutes
  Checklist: Use "Checklist 1: General Claims Exception Review - Step 2"
  Escalate If: Unclear eligibility status after system check
              Emergency services policy interpretation needed

================================================================================
⚠️ WARNING: High-Dollar Claim
================================================================================

Issue: Claim amount $5,500.00 exceeds high-dollar threshold ($5,000.00)

Action Required:
  → Apply "Checklist 2: High-Dollar Claims Review"
  → Verify medical necessity and appropriate level of care
  → Review emergency department coding and charges
  → Consider: Is Level 5 ER visit (99285) appropriate for diagnoses?
  → Check: Any additional documentation requirements for high-dollar ER claims

Note: High-dollar review applies AFTER eligibility issue is resolved

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS FOR REVIEWER
================================================================================

Priority Actions:
  1. [CRITICAL] Resolve eligibility exception (see detailed analysis above)
  2. [HIGH] If approved: Apply high-dollar claim review process
  3. [MEDIUM] Document resolution in claims system with rationale
  4. [LOW] Consider trading partner outreach (high exception rate)

Estimated Review Time: 20-25 minutes total
  - Eligibility verification: ~15 minutes
  - High-dollar review (if applicable): ~10 minutes

Checklists to Use:
  ☐ Checklist 1: General Claims Exception Review - Step 2 (Eligibility)
  ☐ Checklist 2: High-Dollar Claims Review (if claim approved)

Escalation Criteria:
  - Unclear member eligibility status after system verification
  - Emergency services policy interpretation needed
  - Unusual ER charge amount for services rendered
  - Provider billing pattern concerns
