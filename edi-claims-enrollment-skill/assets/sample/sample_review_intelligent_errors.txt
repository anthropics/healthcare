================================================================================

Claim ID: CLM98765
Control Number: 0002
Priority: HIGH 🔴
Status: EXCEPTION - HUMAN REVIEW REQUIRED

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
❌ Member Not Eligible on Service Date
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QUICK DIAGNOSIS:
  Member ID: MBR87654321
  Name: SMITH, JANE K
  Service Date: 2024-03-05
  Coverage Status: Terminated
  Termination Date: 2024-03-01 (4 days before service)
  Plan: ACME HEALTH PLAN

CONTEXT:
  Claim Amount: $5,500.00
  Service Type: Emergency Department Visit - High Severity
  Procedure Code: 99285
  Place of Service: 23 (Emergency Room - Hospital)
  Provider: MERCY HOSPITAL (NPI: 2345678901)
  Diagnosis: I10 (Essential hypertension), E119 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus)

POSSIBLE CAUSES:

  1. ✓ Most likely: Member coverage actually terminated
     Confidence: 60%

     Common after: Employment termination, non-payment, voluntary drop

     Verify: Check member status in eligibility system

     What to look for:
     - Termination reason code
     - Employment end date alignment
     - Premium payment history
     - COBRA election status

  2. ⚠️ Possible: Retroactive termination error
     Confidence: 25%

     Pattern: Recent termination may be data entry error

     Why this matters: Only 4 days between termination and service date
     - Could be accidental early termination
     - May be pending correction in next 834 file

     Action: Check for pending 834 corrections or contact employer

     Red flags indicating error:
     - No employment termination record
     - Member believes they have coverage
     - Recent retroactive corrections from this employer

  3. 🔍 Consider: Emergency services exception may apply
     Confidence: 15%

     Detected: Service code 99285 indicates high-severity emergency care

     Rule: Emergency services often covered regardless of eligibility status
     - EMTALA requirements mandate stabilization treatment
     - Many states require coverage of emergency services
     - Member may not have had choice of provider

     Verify: Confirm emergency nature and apply state/plan exception rules

     What constitutes an emergency:
     - Sudden onset of severe symptoms
     - Prudent layperson standard
     - Life or limb threatening condition
     - Documentation in medical record

⚠️ High-Dollar Claim Detected (Non-blocking warning)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QUICK DIAGNOSIS:
  Claim Amount: $5,500.00
  Threshold: $5,000.00 (institutional), $2,500.00 (professional)
  Overage: $500.00 above threshold
  Service Type: Emergency department visit

CONTEXT:
  Procedure: 99285 (Emergency department visit - high severity)
  Units: 1
  Average charge for 99285: $3,200 - $4,800 nationwide
  This charge: $5,500.00 (high end of range, +15%)
  Provider: MERCY HOSPITAL

CHARGE ANALYSIS:

  🟡 MEDIUM CONCERN: Charge is above threshold but within reasonable range

  Comparison to benchmarks:
  - Typical 99285 charges: $3,200 - $4,800
  - This claim: $5,500.00 (115% of high end)
  - May reflect facility fees, supplies, or geographic variation

  Provider historical pattern:
  - MERCY HOSPITAL average 99285 charge: $4,200
  - This claim: $5,500 (131% of provider's average)
  - Interpretation: Slightly higher than this provider's norm

  💡 Higher charge may be justified by:
  - Emergency complexity (high severity level)
  - Geographic location (high-cost metro area)
  - Facility fees and emergency supplies included
  - After-hours or weekend services

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:

  Since charge is within reasonable range:

  1. Apply standard high-dollar review (Checklist 2)
     - Verify no unbundling of services
     - Confirm no duplicate charges
     - Check modifier usage is appropriate

  2. Manager notification required (claims >$5,000)
     - Per policy, claims over $5,000 require manager awareness
     - No manager approval needed if otherwise valid

  3. Process normally if eligibility resolved
     - High charge alone is not grounds for denial
     - Apply contracted rate or usual & customary if higher

  4. Request itemized bill only if:
     - Charge exceeds $7,500 OR
     - 150%+ of provider average OR
     - Other suspicious indicators present

ESTIMATED ADDITIONAL TIME: +5 minutes for high-dollar review
ACTION REQUIRED: Notify claims manager per policy
